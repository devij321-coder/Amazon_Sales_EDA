This step is very important especially when we arrive at modeling the data in order to apply Machine learning. Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot and many more. It often takes much time to explore the data. Through the process of EDA, we can ask to define the problem statement or definition on our data set which is very important."

        "An outlier is a point or set of points that are different from other points. Sometimes they can be very high or very low. It's often a good idea to detect and remove the outliers. Because outliers are one of the primary reasons for resulting in a less accurate model. Hence it's a good idea to remove them. The outlier detection and removing that I am going to perform is called IQR score technique. Often outliers can be seen with visualizations using a box plot. Shown below are the box plot of MSRP, Cylinders, Horsepower and EngineSize. Herein all the plots, you can find some points are outside the box they are none other than outliers. The technique of finding and removing outlier that I am performing in this assignment is taken help of a tutorial from[ towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/ways-to-detect-and-remove-the-outliers-404d16608dba)."
